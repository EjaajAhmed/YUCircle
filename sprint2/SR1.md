## 🧭 Sprint 1 Overview

## 🎉 What Worked Well

- **Clear task delegation**  
  Each team member had a specific story assigned, which created clear ownership and accountability.

- **Consistent communication through standups**  
  Regular check-ins helped everyone stay aligned, reduced uncertainty, and ensured progress transparency.

- **Solid teamwork and support**  
  Team members helped each other when needed, especially when implementing dependent features or debugging issues.

## ⚠️ What Didn’t Work Well

- **Story dependency blocking**  
  Some stories were blocked because they relied on prerequisites.  
  For example:
  - *Login to Account* depended on *Signup for Account*
  - *Email Verification* depended on *Signup* logic being fully implemented  
  These dependencies caused delays and slowed progress at times.

- **Complexity underestimation**  
  The *Upload Schedule* story was larger and more complex than expected, resulting in it being carried over to Sprint 2.

## 🔄 What We Should Continue Doing

- **Maintain constant communication**  
  Standups and ad hoc discussions were extremely effective — we should keep this habit.

- **Continue supporting each other**  
  Helping teammates who are stuck or blocked improved overall progress and team morale.

- **Write clean, maintainable code**  
  Clean code practices from Sprint 1 paved the way for easier integration and fewer merge conflicts.

## 📌 Summary
Sprint 1 established the foundational backbone of YUCircle. The team collaborated effectively, delivered the core authentication features, and built early user-facing functionality such as posting and profiles. Despite some dependency-related blockers and underestimating the complexity of the schedule upload feature, the sprint successfully set the stage for a strong Sprint 2 focused on enhancing usability and completing advanced features.
