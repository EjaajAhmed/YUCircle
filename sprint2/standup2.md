Answer the following questions: What did you do since last standup? What are you planning/continuing to do? Any blockages?

Jason: Since last standup, I researched the possibilities of having real-time communication via websockets, I wasn't sure which framework/libary exists, until I found Spring WebSocket + STOMP. I am implementing it currently, having both live chating feature, and also storing
chat logs in the DB for chat history.

Ejaaj: Since the last standup, I have worked on increased functionality for the User Profile feature. I'm looking to add save features for profile edits, where they are saved onto the database. I have also reasearched the possiblity of adding security features, like TLS/SSL to protect the server from attacks. 

Alice: Since the last standup, I've created an Azure Document Intelligence resource and am planning to use the API to parse uploaded schedules for the upload-schedule feature. No blockages code-wise so far, but when I tried parsing a schedule in Document Intelligence Studio, the AI seemed like it might have trouble mapping some courses to their times.

David: Since the last standup, I have begun working on implementing the 'Search for Other Students' feature for our YUCircle app. I am currently working on the user interface for this feature and connecting it to the backend which will search through the database of users of our app. 

Brandon: Since the last standup, I worked on the feature to view posts. So far, I have implemented the ability for a user to see the posts that they have created on the User Profile page. I also added a like and comment button on each of these posts so that the user can like and create/view comments on their posts on the user page. No blockages so far, will continue to look for ways to add onto this feature, potentially to edit and delete posts (one of the next user stories).
