Answer the following questions: What did you do since last standup? What are you planning/continuing to do? Any blockages?

**Jason:** Since the last standup, I completed most of the Signup for Account feature and started implementing Email Verification. Today, I’ll continue working on sending verification emails and token validation. No major blockages—just some time integrating with email services.

**Brandon:** I finished the initial version of the Make a Post feature and connected backend and frontend successfully. Today, I’ll refine the UI and add input validation. No blockages other than some minor styling issues.

**Ejaaj:** I continued development on the User Profile feature and connected the profile data to the database. Today, I will work on rendering profile details and enhancing the Person class. No blockages right now.

**David:** Since last standup, I completed most of the login backend logic. Today, I’ll integrate the login UI and start testing. Only blockage is dependency on the signup feature being finished to test properly.

**Alice:** I created the Upload Schedule UI and drafted the backend requirements. Today, I’ll start implementing the backend logic for uploading schedule files. I’m partially blocked because the exact data structure for schedule storage is still being finalized.
