Answer the following questions: What did you do since last standup? What are you planning/continuing to do? Any blockages?

**Jason:** Since last standup, I began working on the Signup for Account feature and set up the user model and controller. Today, I’ll continue implementing the signup form validation and linking the endpoint to the frontend. No major blockages so far.

**Brandon:** I started working on the Make a Post feature, setting up the backend route and the initial UI. Today, I plan to connect the frontend with the backend and test creating a post end-to-end. No blockages yet.

**Ejaaj:** I began building the User Profile feature and created the initial profile page structure. Today, I will continue implementing the profile data model and begin database integration. No blockages at this time.

**David:** I finished setting up my environment and reviewed the authentication flow for the Login feature. Today, I will implement the login endpoint and start connecting it to the frontend. No current blockages.

**Alice:** I researched how schedule uploads should work and explored file parsing options. Today, I’ll design the Upload Schedule UI and outline the backend requirements. Only blockage is deciding how parsed schedule data will be stored, but I will clarify with the team.
