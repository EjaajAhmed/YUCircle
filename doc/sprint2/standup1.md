Answer the following questions: What did you do since last standup? What are you planning/continuing to do? Any blockages?

**Jason:** Last time we finished sprint 1, and I recorded the demo video, made sure everything works. Today, I am starting a new ticket, chat with other students.

**Brandon:** Last sprint, I worked on the feature to Make a Post, making sure it worked on both frontend and backend. In sprint 1 I had some difficulties in setting up the environment (downloading Node.js, PostgreSQL, etc.) , but other than that no blockages. Today, I will start building on the Make a Post feature by working on the View Post ticket.

**Ejaaj:** In Sprint 1 I set up the User Profile and integrated it with an updated Person class. Since then I, along with other members of the group, have discussed the next stage of YU Circle. We have split up the tasks and I chose to add a Password Reset and Notifications function to the app. Last Sprint I had difficulty in testing my features and setting up my enviornment. Hopefully these blockages will be kept to a minimum after our experiences from Sprint 1.

**David:** Since the last standup, I have implemented the 'Login' feature of our application. For Sprint 2, I will be working on the 'Search for other students' feature. 

**Alice:** Last sprint, I was working on the feature for uploading schedules, but ran into some problems with running the application. I will continue working on this feature for this sprint and also incorporate the schedule editing feature once that's done.
