Answer the following questions: What did you do since last standup? What are you planning/continuing to do? Any blockages?

Jason: Since last standup, I finished the live chat using websockets and STOMP. However, there is a blocker, I need the story of viewing posts to be finished first, otherwise I wouldn't know who to message. Right now, you can chat with a fixed user in my database, however it does not save (messages) to db for now.

Brandon: Since last standup, I have been testing the features i have implemented in terms of liking and commenting on a user's own posts (QA testing these features from both frontend and backend), and so far and unable to find any bugs. I will continue to test for errors and prepare for the demo of this feature for sprint2.

Ejaaj: Since the last standup, I have added the functionality of changing fields in the user profile. I have faced blockers in terms of my coding environment, where certain files won't compile properly, specifically in regards to lombok. I have worked around it with my own custom files, but merging may be difficult. I will continue this along with the other featues of Sprint 2.

Alice: Since the last standup, I got the backend and frontend of the upload-schedule feature working, albeit with some parsing issues (i.e. courses aren't being mapped to the right times). Though the feature is working so far, I still need to get the schedule to be displayed. I plan to work on displaying the schedule and once finished, to address the parsing issues, I'll get started on the edit-schedule feature.

David: The feature has been mostly completed since the last standup. Since then, I have just been debugging and fixing any errors in the code.
