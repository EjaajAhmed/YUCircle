- Make a Post
- Login to Account

## 📋 Sprint 1 User Story Decisions

We decided to have basic authentication/authorization as one of our main focuses for this sprint, as each student/account will have different information, without this,
it is impossible to get the rest of the stories implemented. Once that is done, we decided to also include some basic features that will entice users to actually use our application,
aside from the minimum basic requirements. This includes, uploading the schedule, so students can find other people on campus during this time,
making a post (looking for friends), and a user profile that other users can see, which includes things such as their bio, major, interests, name, and many more.

## Task Breakdown
First, user authentication/authorization needs to be completed.

These are:

- Signup for account
- Login to account
- Email verification

Next, our "prize" features (what gets the user to join) will be implemented.
- Upload Schedule
- User Profile
- Make a Post
