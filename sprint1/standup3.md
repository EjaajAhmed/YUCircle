Answer the following questions: What did you do since last standup? What are you planning/continuing to do? Any blockages?

**Jason:** Since last standup, I completed the Email Verification feature. Today, I’ll be finalizing the Signup flow end-to-end and preparing for integration testing. No blockages at the moment.

**Brandon:** I wrapped up the Make a Post feature and ensured it works across frontend and backend. Today, I’m helping others test their features and doing cleanup work. No blockages.

**Ejaaj:** I completed the main components of the User Profile feature, including rendering data and updating the model. Today, I’m cleaning up the UI and addressing some minor bugs. No major blockages.

**David:** Since last standup, I fully completed the Login feature and connected it to the frontend. Today, I’ll be testing the full authentication flow and assisting with integration. No blockages.

**Alice:** I made progress on the Upload Schedule backend implementation but ran into issues getting the app to run consistently. Today, I’ll continue debugging environment issues and keep working on the upload logic. These environment problems are currently blocking me from fully testing the feature.
