Answer the following questions: What did you do since last standup? What are you planning/continuing to do? Any blockages?

**Jason:** I am finishing up the chat since last standup, currently I am working on the new tickets assigned. 

**Brandon:** Since last standup, I worked on the next user story that built off of my last story (view-posts) and further impkemented it so that users can now edit and delete their posts, along with being able to delete comments from posts as well. Forward, I will try to work on the next user story of adding a enable dark/light mode feature.

**Ejaaj:** Since last standup, I have tested worked with testing some featues as well as planning for the final Sprint. For this sprint I will be adding notifications for the user, which will be placed in a notification bar either to the side or on the user profile.

**David:** 

**Alice:** Last sprint, I finished making the feature to upload schedules. There were some merge conflicts, so after fixing that, I started working on the feature to display/edit the schedules. I'll keep working on that and hopefully get the schedule matching feature out after that.
